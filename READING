HOW TO BE A BETTER READER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

                   Choosing the right book
Do you want to read for enjoyment or for knowledge?

Do you want to stretch yourself in some way?

Are you looking for escapism? (There’s nothing wrong with that!)

Do you want to be part of the cultural conversation around the current “it” book?

Are you curious about a book that has been atop the best-seller list for months?
