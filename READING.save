HOW TO BE A BETTER READER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

                   Choosing the right book
Do you want to read for enjoyment or for knowledge?

Do you want to stretch yourself in some way?

Are you looking for escapism? (There’s nothing wrong with that!)

Do you want to be part of the cultural conversation around the current “it” book?

Are you curious about a book that has been atop the best-seller list for months?





To read more deeply stimulates your imagination.









At a time when most of us read in superficial, bite-size chunks that prize 
quickness — texts, tweets, emails — it can be difficult to retrain your brain 
to read at an unhurried pace, but it is essential. 
In “Slow Reading in a Hurried Age,” David Mikics writes that “slow reading 
changes your mind the way exercise changes your body: A whole new world will 
open up, you will feel and act differently, because books will be more open 
and alive to you.”














Next time you read your book, try this:


1. Stop and ask yourself questions.i.e:What techniques is the author using to 
build so much suspense?”

2. Consider whether you agree with the book or disagree with it.

3. Think about what makes good writing.i.e:If you’re reading one of Lee 
Child’s thrillers, for example, take the time to note how carefully he 
choreographs his elaborate fight scenes, and ask yourself why they work so 
well. 












(Studies show that when people read a passage and then take a test on the 
material, they do no better than people who have had the passage read to them.)
      









Use your cell phone for good. 
Try an audiobook. 
Mix and match formats.












Reading may be a solitary endeavor, but once we’re done with a book, most of 
us want to do the same thing: talk to other people about what we loved, what 
we hated, what we didn’t understand. No matter where you are in the book you 
are currently reading, today’s the day to find a place to talk about it.

There are many ways to do that:


Join an online book club. 
Find your author on social media.












Enhance yout post-book experience
Start a reading journal or reading log. 
Create a future book journal. 
Challenge yourself to read outside your comfort zone. 
Read for breadth
